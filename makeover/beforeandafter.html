  <h2>Before and after</h2>
    <p>Almost all of our yearly gatherings are celebrated around the dinner table, and often, we make too much food to eat in one sitting. The following recipes are based around meals and occasions my family and friends celebrate with food. <br><br>

You may not take part in any of these festivities, and if you do, perhaps you don’t observe them with the reused main dishes outlined in this section. Even so, you may find that throughout your year many of the foods you eat result in similar leftovers. If you don’t have leftover turkey, maybe you’ll be able to, instead, try the Thanksgiving recipes with chicken, lamb, tofu, or roasted veggies, for example. <br><br>

I look forward to learning more about other cultures and diets, their common leftovers, and the creative and delicious ways people use them up. <br><br>
